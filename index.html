    <h1>Kukaye...</h1>
    <p>There are many things I could say today. But I want this to be real.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Our Beginning</h2>
    <p>
        We met in church. Not randomly.  
        As young adults ministry leaders.  
        God placed us in the same space, serving Him.
        <br><br>
        Before I even knew you deeply,  
        you respected me.  
        You appreciated me.  
        You listened to me.  
        You made me feel accepted.
        <br><br>
        That feeling... changed something in me.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>The Moment That Meant Everything</h2>
    <p>
        The day you came back and asked to build again...
        I don’t think you fully understand what that did to my heart.
        <br><br>
        It takes strength for a woman to rethink, reflect, and choose again.
        You didn’t act from pride.
        You acted from sincerity.
        <br><br>
        That moment made me respect you even more.
        It showed me your depth.
        Your courage.
        Your heart.
        <br><br>
        That was one of the most beautiful moments of my life.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Why I Love You</h2>
    <p>
        1️⃣ The way you accepted me before fully knowing me.
        You gave me comfort like it was natural for you.
        <br><br>
        2️⃣ Your clean heart.
        You look strong and independent on the outside,
        but inside you are soft, compassionate, and deeply beautiful.
        <br><br>
        3️⃣ Loving you became more than feelings.
        It became clarity.
        My mind, my heart, my eyes — they all agreed.
        <br><br>
        And yes… you are gorgeous.
        Your smile.
        Your hair.
        Your face.
        Your everything.
        <br><br>
        Even your wide nails that make me laugh every time 😌
    </p>

<section>
    <h2>You Are My Person</h2>
    <p>
        I know sometimes you feel like you are not fully understood.
        And I want you to know — I am learning.
        I am growing.
        I am trying to understand you deeper.
        <br><br>
        You are patient with me.
        You stay.
        You trust.
        <br><br>
        I see that.
        And I don’t take it lightly.
        <br><br>
        You are graduating soon.
        A medical physics queen.
        A singer with an angelic voice.
        A playful, crazy, beautiful soul.
        <br><br>
        And through everything,
        I know one thing clearly —
        I love you from the bottom of my heart.
        <br><br>
        Not exaggerated.
        Not dramatic.
        Just real.
